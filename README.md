# 🐍 Programming Fundamentals with Python – January 2024

This repository contains my personal solutions to all practical tasks and coding exercises completed during the **"Programming Fundamentals with Python"** course at **SoftUni**, held in the January 2024 cohort. All solutions are organized by topic, date, and type of activity (lab, exercise, exam, etc.), following the structure of the official curriculum.

⚠️ **Please note:** This repository does **not** include the original task descriptions or assignments, in accordance with SoftUni's policy. Only my personally written solution code is included.

## 📖 Overview

The goal of this repository is to serve as a structured archive of my progress throughout the course, and as a reference for practicing core programming concepts in Python. It reflects my hands-on work with various fundamental topics, and demonstrates gradual improvement in logic, syntax, and problem-solving skills.

Each folder is named according to a consistent format:


## 📁 Examples

- `03.1_lists_basics_lab_24_01_24` – Lab on basic list operations, held on 📅 January 24, 2024  
- `07.2_mid_exam_retake_14_02_24` – Mid-course exam retake simulation, held on 📅 February 14, 2024

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository includes all core topics from the Programming Fundamentals course syllabus:
- 🧾 Basic syntax, input/output, and conditionals  
- 🔢 Data types and variables  
- 📚 Lists – basic and advanced operations  
- 🛠 Functions and modular code  
- 🗂 Dictionaries and nested structures  
- 🧱 Objects and classes (OOP basics)  
- ✉️ Text and string processing  
- 💡 Bitwise logic and binary operations

- 🌐 Intro to HTML & CSS  
- 📝 Mid and final exam preparation  
- 🧪 Full exam simulations and retakes  

## 👨‍💻 Usage

Browse and review the solutions for practice or learning purposes. Each file demonstrates a practical application of a key programming concept, designed to reinforce understanding through hands-on coding.

All code is written in **Python 3.10+** and organized by week, topic, and activity type.

## 🧾 Final Note

This repository reflects my personal progress throughout the course. It is shared publicly for educational and reference purposes only. No original task descriptions are included.

If you're also learning – feel free to explore the code, but be sure to work through the logic on your own. That’s how real progress happens.

Happy coding! 🚀🐍
